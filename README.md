## Setup & Installation

CanLite is built using Node.js, pnpm, and PostgreSQL. To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/canlite24/canlite.git
   cd canlite
   ```
2. Install dependencies using pnpm:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   pnpm run build
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

Ensure that PostgreSQL is properly configured before running the application.

## Private Links

Private links require your own domain or subdomain. CanLite will not issue a usable private link on a raw server IP, so you need to point a hostname you control at the server first.

The simplest option is to use a free subdomain from [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/):

1. Create an account on FreeDNS.
2. Add a subdomain under one of their shared public domains, or use a domain you already own.
3. Create an `A` record pointing that hostname to your CanLite server's public IPv4 address.
4. Wait for DNS to propagate.
5. Use that hostname when setting up or sharing your private link.

If you already have your own domain with another DNS provider, the setup is the same: create a subdomain and point an `A` record at the server running CanLite.

Notes:
- The hostname must resolve to the server before private links will work correctly.
- Do not use the server IP directly for a private link.
- If you change servers later, update the DNS record to the new public IP.
